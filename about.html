<p>Full stack web developer with a passion for classical music in the 21st century. With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React and a background in music performance, I discovered web development through my work in software implementation and customer service. I bring strong skills in team-building and project management that help startups develop their vision into real world solutions. I love making music. Whether it is playing in a saxophone choir, singing in a barbershop quartet, or sitting alone at a piano, I cannot get enough.</p>
