No one is born with the knowledge and skill required to speak.  It takes a year or two of observation before we even attempt speech.  At that point, we begin a grueling process of trial and error before understanding how to reproduce a language’s soundscape.  Yet, almost all of us come out on the other side of testing as capable orators, or conversationalists. As children:

1. We learn that everyone speaks.  We hypothesize that we can too.
2.	Our speech skills begin paying off well before they are refined to a satisfactory state.

These observations resonate with my experience learning to code.  

**People of all walks of life learn to code, it doesn’t take a special personal history.**

Like a toddler observing peers and mentors speaking, there are many ways to see self-taught programmers or boot camp graduates finding success in the software industry.  If you have the desire to do so, it is feasible.  While coding isn’t basic human necessity, it manifests as a highly valued skill that can be acquired by a healthy variety of individuals from different walks of life.  Conscious or unconscious, we decide to embark on journeys to acquire skills. Speech and coding parallel each other with a similar incentive.  Many people do this, so can you.

**You can contribute even when your skills are fledgling.**

There is so much to learn as a web developer, even if you limit your scope to a single language or framework.  Basic, essential skills extend so far that one never truly is finished learning and refining that knowledge.  Luckily, you can begin participating in the craft well before you become an expert.  You can do so, even as a novice.  Many websites can be written with a simple file structure of HTML and CSS.  Though these skills represent a small subset of Web Development as a whole.  People who possess these skills only can contribute to larger projects. 

When a toddler is hungry for dinner, if they have learned how to express it even in broken words, there is a real and tangible benefit they are presenting.  Actions can be taken to get them fed in a timely manner and prevent an impending meltdown.  This significantly improves the quality of life for all others around.  Contributing even a little, matters.

**Conclusion**

It is frustrating to feel like you are bad at something for a prolonged period.  This is certainly a reality when learning to speak and learning to code.  Yet, we persist.  Something internal propels us forward to stick with it and trust that the progress we see, no matter how small, is still progress.  Encouragement comes in many forms. Witnessing the success of those around us and watching our own contributions payoff build a reservoir of confidence that slowly fills.  There may be periods where we see no improvement, or our normal sources for encouragement dry up.  We rely on our confidence reservoir to weather these periods, so our persistence can keep the learning process intact.
