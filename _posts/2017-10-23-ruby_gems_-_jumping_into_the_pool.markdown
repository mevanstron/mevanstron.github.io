So far, the work I’ve done with the ruby language, while expansive, has been encapsulated in existing project structures.  While offering space to stretch my ability to code and reason, there hasn’t been too much focus on owning my project structure or the management of charting progress through github.  This all changed when I began coding my first ruby gem.

The beginning of this process is something I would harken to jumping into a pool.  *I know this is something I can do, I know this is something I will enjoy, but the transition is daunting and I’m plenty comfortable staying on this side of it for just a little longer.  *

Just like someone who stpped up to that cool enticing threshold, eventually I took the plunge.

**Nuts and bolts**

“If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.” – Carl Sagan

Once I rolled up my sleeves and started making my Gem, I realized that all sorts of things needed to be examined and adjusted in my work environment that hadn’t presented an issue to date.  

A long time inspecting why I couldn’t change ownership of a file in my project directory showed me that I needed to install a new version of my terminal. Creating a project and syncing it in github was also a new challenge that I hadn’t even considered up to this point.  

And while these specific examples won’t persist as universal challenges, they showed me that starting “one” new thing will generally ripple into many new things at once.  

**Ownership**

After initial wrestling, I wrangled all the necessary pieces to get started on the meat of the project:

*write code that does a thing. * 

As I began defining behaviors, second guessing naming conventions, and converting errors to intended functions, I noticed an increasing sense of pride in the project.  As of the penning of this blog post, my gem does everything that I set out for it to do.  It still needs refactoring and a 3rd party review, but the content is there.  Regardless, I’ve built a ruby gem from start to finish.  I created the project directory, I chose its purpose, I wrote the code, and it works.  

This marks a milestone for my first real sense of accomplishment as a programmer.  This is the msot valuable takeaway from this experience.

**Embracing Newness**

To me, this project had three distinct and successive identities,  

*Trepidation ~ Engineering ~ Attainment*

At first, the newness of the project stayed my hand.  I hesitated to begin but can now look back on a very satisfying journey.  As I move forward, I hope to embrace the new part of a project instead of fearing it.  Eventually, I hope to get used to the newness of things as they come my way.
