This is my first blog post and I’d like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and expand on why I’ve chosen web development as my career path moving forward.  To do this, I’ll be focusing on three primary topics:

* Where I’ve been
* Where I am
* Where I’m going

I’ll employ some help from the Simpsons family to help tell my story:

**Where I’ve been**

As a kid and young adult, I decided the life of a classical musician was for me.  With an affinity for the saxophone, encouragement from my parents and teachers, and a genuine interest in all things musical, I enjoyed a very satisfying and fulfilling trajectory into the world of music from ages 12 to 21.  

However, my junior year of college is when I really began to struggle moving forward transitioning between student and professional musician.  More of what I loved about being a musician became less of a focus, and the infrastructure that helped sustain my earlier efforts was fading away as more of that responsibility fell onto me.   

After several more years of dubious progress, I eventually decided that a lifelong career in music was simply not something I needed to pursue.  This was the first instance time I asked myself, “if not music, then what?”

**Where I am**

Since moving away from music I’ve worked in both software implementation and consulting.  This represents a period where my career has taken a backseat to my personal life and priorities therein.  

This is the time in which I met and married my wife, bought our house and developed some skills outside of music such as technical troubleshooting and customer support.  I’ve taken this time to focus on a passion of mine that had always clashed with my musical studies, intense gaming!  

I’ve hopped off the deep end of the swimming pool into [Magic the Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en), [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/), and [League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/).  These pillars in my gaming life are propped up by a variety of other games such as Bridge, 7-wonders, and other various board and computer games.

**Where I am going**

“Where I am” seems pretty like a good place.  My personal life is growing in the direction I want, and I have plenty of satisfaction at home.  Why is there a need for a change?  Well, looking down the road, I don’t see much continued engagement through my current work.  40 hours a week over 35 years (my estimation of how much longer I have before retirement) is a lot of time to spend going through motions or waiting to be doing something else.  

So, I’ve decided I’m going to chase after something with a little more depth, a puzzle I can spend 35 years tinkering with and never fully solve; Software and Web Development.   

If there’s one thing I love, it’s progression.  Taking the journey from novice to expert in saxophone, leveling from 1 – 100 in [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/), settling your first city to achieving a Science Victory in [Civilization VI](https://www.civilization.com/).  

It’s too early in the journey to tell, but I believe that joining the software and web development community will offer the lifelong challenge I’m looking for.  This is where I’m going and I couldn’t be more excited to see where it leads.
