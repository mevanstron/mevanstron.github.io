One month separated the two halves of my Rails combined with JavaScript final project.  During that month, my time was devoted to preparing for a family member’s wedding and taking a trip across the Atlantic.  Not only did my project stall, but some of the skills I needed to complete the project dulled as well.  Getting back in gear to focus on project completion wasn’t easy.  What was in need of recovery the most was my confidence.

Working with JavaScript has been eye opening, and the utility it brings to web applications are vital and plentiful.  But JS didn’t come as naturally to me as Ruby.  Learning how to work with procedural JS and moving onto API calls with jQuery and AJAX presented new challenges to me as a programmer.  I was only beginning to feel confident using them when my break began.  Unfortunately, I returned from the month away, and these concepts weren’t as fresh in my mind.  I felt intimidated by my loss of familiarity with JS.  By approaching the issue in the following three ways, I began 
to rebuild my confidence and position myself to complete my project successfully.

**Review Code**

The process of code review fulfilled 2 important purposes when returning from my break.  

The first was to reacquaint myself with the language and style being used in the program so far.  There are many practices and approaches I could have used to accomplish the various aspects of the program.  Reviewing my code gave me the chance to pick up where I left off and continue with a uniform approach. 

The second purpose is to provide reminders of where I was in the process, where my pain points were, and where my successes were.  Unfamiliar code can look like one big puzzle that needs solving.  Once I regained familiarity, I could recognize the stable pieces versus those that were broken or needed further development.  Reviewing my code not only helped figure out where my next tangible steps in coding were, but it also helped me feel confident stepping back into the process.

**Review Key Concepts**

Now that I had regained footing on my code and the concepts therein, taking a moment to review key concepts in my educational materials gave me confidence apply what was needed to my program.  I took time to review working with the Serializer gem, writing API calls using jQuery and AJAX, working with the DOM, and even using Debugger for testing.  Some of the review didn’t feel necessary while I was going over it, but even if I knew what I was reading, it all helped build my confidence as I prepared to transition into the final step in this process…

**Start Plugging Away**

The last thing I had to do, was start coding!  Review and prep all have their place, but nothing replaces the act of coding.  When it comes down to it, nothing makes you feel like a coder like coding.  A little bit of program design, coding, research, and troubleshooting all brought me back home and made me feel like I was doing what I needed. For me, this was the last step to getting back confidence after a long break.

**Final**

Taking a long break from coding, especially as a junior level web developer, can rattle anyone’s confidence.  For me, reviewing my code, reviewing educational materials, and diving back in, were the three primary practices connected to regaining my confidence as a programmer.
