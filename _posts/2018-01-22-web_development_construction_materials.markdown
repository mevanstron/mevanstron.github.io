In older times, one had to cut down a tree to build a house.  Harvesting lumber, designing the frame, and managing construction all fell to the person who needed the shelter.  Now, all you need is money to hire a contractor to manage the project.  The wood planks are already prepared, blue prints are tested and ready to go, and teams of plumbers, electricians, and framers are on call to do the construction.  Building a website, is like building a house.

In web development, we are no longer fending for ourselves in the wild frontier.  Resources abound to aid in the creation of web content.  In the world of Ruby, alone, a multitude of Gems exist to ease the burden of creation:

[Active Record](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) – An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) structure to manage communication between Ruby code and a database.  This manages communication from the content of a website to a database in a unified language.

[Rack](https://rack.github.io/) / [Shotgun](https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun) -  This provides a way to start a server that hosts the content of your website.  Shotgun is particularly useful during development and testing as it updates in real-time without having to be closed and relaunched to display new content.

[Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html) – A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that offers a variety of tools to build a website framework.  A key piece of what Sinatra has to offer, routes, enables a developer to create pathways and behaviors that will govern the user experience and flow of a website.  These routes are the media through which data moves from a browser to a database.

In our house building analogy, the homeowner is the client who needs a website, and the contractor is the web developer.  The web developer assembles their gems and resources before a single line of ruby code is written.  A contractor acquires materials like piping and lumber before a single board is placed or nail is hammered.

One chief difference between housing and coding is the investment in materials.  Building a website has no physical environment (although, technically, a server does occupy physical space).  This means construction can be much more flexible than that of a house.  Halfway through constructing a house, a decision cannot be made to use steel beams instead of wood without incurring enormous cost, whereas an entire website’s CSS scheme can be changed from Bootstrap to Zimit in a few seconds with a $0 cost.

My experience building my first web app gave clear indication as to which resources are my star players.  Gaining repetitions in this process, will expose new resources that I simply can’t live without.  I’ll also learn which are dispensable and can be phased out or replaced.
