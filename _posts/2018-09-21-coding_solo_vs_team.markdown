## Introduction

This weekend I attended the 4th [Austin Diversity Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/atxdivhack/) hosted by [Women Who Code Austin](https://www.womenwhocode.com/austin).  Before I dive into the meat of this post, I want to express my gratitude to the event coordinators.  It was extremely well run, and I was thrilled to engage with and meet so many people from such a range of backgrounds.

Over three days, I attended seminars and participated in a team coding challenge.  I enjoyed working on a team immensely and felt strong contrasts against my typical solo practices.  This blog post will highlight some of those differences.

## Decision Making

When working alone there is one authority, the individual.  This means one doesn’t have to get sign off from other stakeholders, or field ideas from a committee.   One can have ideas and implement them with almost no delay.  However, there are shortcomings.  Committees exist for a reason.  Different perspectives can refine ideas and enhance their potential when implemented.  

In the hackathon, my team had some issues scaling down the ambition of our initial build.  It took several voices from the team to convince one of our members to scale back our project’s ambition in code to accommodate our steep time constraints.  If we didn’t have a team to weigh in, there may have been nothing but a mound of unfinished code when it came time to present our work.

## Motivation

In a group, we can lean on each other.  Because we all have varied experiences and skill levels, we each bring something different to the table.  Often this means we stretch ourselves to keep pace with our peers.  This is a form of motivation.  I know that when I’m surrounded by capable peers, I’m motivated to perform well. No one wants to fall behind or look like the weak link.  Our team members can also help us keep going when we begin to feel overwhelmed or disillusioned.  It’s not uncommon to lose sight of the goal every now and then.  

In our team project at the hackathon, there were moments where I felt we weren’t on track to meet the expectations I had for our project.  But I knew that my teammates were relying on my JavaScript functions central to our app’s core functionality.  Regardless of how I felt about the long goals of our project, I wanted to do right by my team, and that kept me going.

## Accountability

Ownership of actions boils down to one person when working on a solo project.  If a feature has a flaw in its design, if a deadline is missed, or the visual aesthetic is off, there is one sole contributor.  This goes both ways, though.  Fewer contributors means fewer divisions of rewards and accolades.  If someone is impressed by the product of a solo project, it isn’t difficult to identify the single person who deserves congratulations.  This higher risk / reward atmosphere is pretty black and white and simple to navigate.  It becomes more ambiguous in a group setting.  
In a group, individuals do have accountability.  

However, that is mostly localized to within the group.  Outside of the group, the project team often stands as a unit.  In my recent group project, I didn’t have a single hand in the visual aesthetics of our project aside from some simple choices of where some text might appear on the page.  A single team member handled all css details and did a very fine job.  Inside our group, we all appreciated her contribution and she alone was accountable for the visual design.  Yet in our presentation, the focus of her work diversified onto each of the team members.  We presented the whole project as our work.  

However, we did have a single team member slowing down progress trying to implement new ideas bogging down our design phase.  Our final product had a smaller scope and impact as a result.  In the local team dynamic, the individual held the accountability, and this may affect our likeliness of working with them in the future.  However publicly, we all owned the scope, limitations, and shortcomings of our project.  

## Summary

Whether working solo or on a team, decision making, motivation, and accountability all play major factors in the shape of a project.  There are no universal strengths or weaknesses in one path over the other.  But understanding how each aspect exists in a solo or team environment can help participants watch out for pitfalls and maximize opportunities.
